The packages and library names change frequently and vary across base operating systems.
Adjust the following lines as required by the base operating system.

Install basic build packages:
    sudo apt install autoconf automake autopoint build-essential pkgconf libtool libzip-dev
          libjpeg-dev git libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev
          libwebp-dev gettext libmicrohttpd-dev libmariadb-dev libasound2-dev libfftw3-dev

Once required packages are installed, execute:
    autoreconf -fiv
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Sample custom configuration options:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    --prefix               :  Specify the install location for the motion package
=======
    --prefix               :  Specify the install location for the motionplus package
