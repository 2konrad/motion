Formatting for MotionPlus.

--------------------
RULE 1
Code is generally indented using 4 spaces

--------------------
RULE 2
If a line or statement is broken into two lines you will normally want the text
in the 2nd line to align with text in the first line.  The alignment is done
using spaces making the code on the following lines appear in a natural way below
the corresponding code above. Use common sense to enhance readability.

--------------------
RULE 3
Never use TABS to align anything. A tab may be 4 positions in one editor
<<<<<<< HEAD
and 8 in another. A space is always a space.

RULE 5
Use whitespace, commas, braces and indentation to enhance readability:
  1. No spaces before a comma
  2. Always leave at least one space after a comma
  3. Use one space between a block start statement and a '{'
  4. Do not use a space between a function name and the '('
  5. The '*' for pointers should be just before the variable name with no space.
  6. Use spaces to enhance readability (a non objective rule but at least think about it)

--------------------
RULE 6
Comment the code where it isn't intuitive to new programmers.
Use /* This style of comment for permament comments */ or
/*
 * This style of comment for comments which
 * require more that one line
 */
Use // style comments for something you add temporarily while testing.

--------------------
RULE 7
Use variable names that say what the variable is used for.
